      <h2>COVENANT DAYCARE GARDEN FOUNDATION INVITATION</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          I am sending this personal invitation to you, to formally inform you of my Family plan to establish a Covenant Daycare Garden Initiative for care of the elderly and the widows. We purpose to host the Garden at Egbu -Owerri, Imo State in Memory of our Parents - Pa Joseph Ugochukwu and Mama Bernice Nwobiara Okoro for reason that in life and by GOD’s Grace, they were the bedrocks of four children who became notable citizens as “Stars Not Scars.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary objective is to cater for the healthcare and welfare needs of Covenant ‘Elders and Widows Indeed’ in Owerri and environs; and in the manner that could restore their confidence and dignity as respected individuals and a welcoming community. I am confident that as a man of understanding and a devout and altruistic person, you may feel persuaded to respond positively to this request for support towards establishing the Foundation. May I formally invite you to please consider and accept to be our Soul-Partner with a sense of ownership in this initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enclose a one-page outline of the Covenant Daycare Garden Initiative for your orientation. The page will present Statement of Vision & Mission; Garden Management Funding, Administration and Accountability Framework; Bank Lodgement Account. I feel persuaded that by the Grace of GOD, you shall stand to reap commensurate returns from the prayers of the beneficiaries of unmerited Love you have sown by your ‘across-the-Niger’ contribution and generous funding of this initiative; towards fixing the problems and pains of ‘Covenant Elders and Widows Indeed’ in Egbu - Owerri and environs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you may find the time to join my family on a date, time and venue which I shall, respectfully, communicate to you for the planned presentation of my Memoir captioned “Dare to Live My Passion (The Authentic Memoir of a Passionate Railwayman)” to Soul-Mates, Well-Wishers and Discerning Public for donations towards the Project’s kick-off and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          May I contact your office within the next fortnight to follow up on this invitation? Thanks for your attention and commitment to philanthropy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Yours Sincerely,</strong><br />
          Elder Nath Okoro.

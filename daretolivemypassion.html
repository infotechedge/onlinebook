        Dare To Live My Passion is the Flash Forward /Backward Narrative of how “Passion shaped my experience from my formative years; how it fuelled the fire of inspiration that opened me up to opportunities and challenges; and gave me courage to engage voyages of discovery; confront smokey oven of the Nigerian Civil War and back to dedicated ride by railway train from Ground Alpha as station staff clerk and by GOD’s Grace, to Level Zeta as Nigerian Railway chief executive after the war, but forced prematurely to experience “sunset at dawn” after military invasion of the Nigeria railway management space. The Book is a Pointer to Lessons of my life ; and my understanding of the high points of Life lived truly as an opportunity to be seized; and to blossom where planted...” As Summary the book is an Engagement with Thinkers in the “Thinkers Corner”; and an invitation to the Reader as “Stakeholder and Change Agent, to Share my anecdotal experiences of Life from facts; and as investments of my time and energy in the fields and in ‘schools of hard knocks’ planting seeds I later harvested as fruits; and from the Lives of Great Men as wisdom nuggets captured in the Garden of their Biographies and Memoirs. The Take -Aways have been served in this book “Dare to Live My Passion” as perfect proof of my commitment to deny the graveyard the instructive realties I experienced in my life walking and working at stations on Planet Earth; and owe to the Reader as compelling duty to share facts as refreshing Guidance Notes of Tomorrow. ” Enjoy the Reading.

      <p>
        To Nigerian Mapper, who  is disposed to engage with continuous research on the geography, statistics, geometry, algebra, operations and probability of a matter; and ready to analyse and glean insights into its analytics, using specialized tools to create precise, accurate maps of personality pictures embedded in the 26 Alphabets of English language Education Curriculum and presented as:
